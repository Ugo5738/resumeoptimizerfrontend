          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Resumeguru.pro was born out of a personal challenge faced by our cofounder, an AI/ML engineer with a passion for technology and problem-solving. After applying to several jobs and receiving no responses, it became clear that a generic resume was not enough. The realization hit that each job application required a customized resume to truly reflect the candidate's fit for the role.
          </p>
          <p>
            Determined to find a solution, our cofounder decided to take matters into his own hands. Leveraging his expertise in AI and machine learning, he developed a tool that could optimize resumes and generate personalized cover letters based on specific job descriptions. Armed with this powerful tool, he began applying for jobs again. This time, the results were remarkable. He received multiple responses, including one from Twitter, and eventually landed his dream job (not Twitter).
          </p>
          <p>
            Encouraged by a friend who saw the potential to help others facing the same struggles, our cofounder decided to make this tool available to everyone. And thus, Resumeguru.pro was launched.
